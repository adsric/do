### Nginx

Below are not tutorials but host configuration examples that help improve the web servers
performance and security, while also ensuring that resources are served with the correct content-type and are accessible.

> When you set up hosts, It'd be a good thing if you keep your hosts indexed by domain name.

* [example.com](nginx/example.md) — handles a virtual hosts traffic for both www and non-www
* [no-default](nginx/no-default.md) — drop requests to unknown virtual hosts
* [cdn](nginx/cdn.md) — handles a virtual hosts traffic as a CDN for static files
* [Miscellaneous](nginx/misc.md) - miscellaneous rules

### DB

* [Queries](db/queries.md) — a collection of useful queries for database manipulation.
